The purpose of this project is to develop a sequence of applications that will obtain data from a person’s eye movement using a Tobii Pro Glasses 3 device, while performing a writing test with a Wacom Cintiq graphic tablet.

There are two Applications:
- The HandAQUS application will record data from the two devices.
- AlignData application will be in charge of aligning all the data.

The goal is to determine where someone’s gaze is at any given point while writing. This will assist in studying neurological diseases, such as Parkinson’s.

These applications have been used by students and professors from the same university in the framework of a PECT project, obtaining samples in different civic centers, with real users, approximatelly 150.

These project was developed from an already developed application called "HandAQUS" which permitted to obtain data from a Wacom Cintiq graphic tablet, from this point there has been an addition of numerous new requirements. The base application was developed by : @DzanMucha, https://github.com/BDALab/HandAQUS_for_Cintiq.
